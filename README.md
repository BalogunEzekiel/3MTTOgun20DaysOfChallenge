**3MTTOgun20DaysOfChallenge**

This repository contains Python notebooks created as part of the **3MTT Ogun 20 Days Of Challenge**, an ongoing challenge aimed at improving technical skills, showcase knwoledge and expose 3MTT Fellows to the world through their portfolio projects. Below are details of the two .ipynb files included in this repository:

**Jupyter Notebooks**

**_1. Day 1 Challenge.ipynb_**

**Description:** This notebook contains a simple Python script that performs basic arithmetic calculations.

**Challenge:** Day 1 Challenge of the 3MTTOgun20DaysOfChallenge.

**Features:**

The script allows users to input two numbers.

It performs the following basic arithmetic operations:

_Addition_, _Subtraction_, _Multiplication_, _Division_

**Usage:**

1. Run the notebook.

2. Enter two numbers when prompted.

3. The notebook will display the results of the arithmetic operations.

**_2. Day 1 Challenge(1).ipynb_**

**Description:** This notebook covers the basic Python concepts and demonstrates arithmetic operations.

**Concepts Covered:**

**Variables**: Declaring and assigning values to variables.

**Data Types**: Explanation and examples of common data types like integers, floats, and strings.

**Loops**: Examples of for and while loops.

**Functions**: Creating and calling simple functions.

**Arithmetic Operations:**

The notebook uses two variables: x = 20 and y = 4.

It demonstrates the following operations:

Addition (x + y)

Subtraction (x - y)

Multiplication (x * y)

Division (x / y)

**How to Use**

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/BalogunEzekiel/Day-1-Challenge/tree/main

2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. Run the cells in each notebook to see the code in action.
