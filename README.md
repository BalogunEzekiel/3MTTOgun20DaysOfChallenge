**3MTTOgun20DaysOfChallenge**

This repository contains Python notebooks created as part of the **3MTT Ogun 20 Days Of Challenge**, an ongoing challenge aimed at improving technical skills, showcase knwoledge and expose 3MTT Fellows to the world through their portfolio projects. Below are dialy project challenge:

**Day 1 Challenge: Python for Data Analysis**

🚀 Python Concepts and Scripts for Basic Calculations

The beginning of an exciting journey to hone my skills and showcase my portfolio with advanced projects, leveraging powerful tools from data analysis to data science, including Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Python! 🔥

💡 Task: Understand and master Python concepts such as variables, data types, loops and functions. Write simple Python scripts that perform basic calculations.

🎯 Outcome: I successfully wrote two Python scripts performing basic calculations. These simple yet essential scripts lay the foundation for greater things. You can check them out in my growing portfolio using the links below:

**Day 2 Challenge: Working with Pandas**

🚀 Diving Into Pandas for Data Analysis! 🐼

I delved deeper into data manipulation with Pandas – a powerful tool for any data analyst and scientist!

💡 Task: Loaded the Titanic dataset, cleaned it, and explored different data types using Pandas.

🎯 Outcome: I loaded the [Download the train.csv](C:/Users/win/Desktop/ALL/3MTT/20DaysOfChallenge/1._Dataset/titanic/train.csv) file from the Titanic dataset, cleaned it and explored various data types. A cleaned version, named [Download the my_cleaned_train.csv](C:/Users/win/my_cleaned_train.csv) is now attached. It’s incredible how quickly Pandas helps make sense of large datasets.

**Day 3 Challenge: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

🚀 Uncovering Insights with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

The focus is on diving deeper into the Titanic dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis.

💡 Task: Perform EDA on missing data, summary statistics, and outliers.

🎯 Outcome: I compiled a detailed EDA report that includes insights on missing values, summary statistics and detected outliers. This report, providing key insights into the dataset’s structure and patterns, is now part of my portfolio.
